# Straticast Backend
This is the backend to my React weather app called Straticast. This Ruby on Rails backend stores user logins and validates them with a working authorization system.
## Requirements
To run this backend locally, you should have a development environment that can run Ruby commands, such as a MacOS or Linux environments. Unfortunately, this cannot be run on a Windows computer. <br />
## Usage
To get it up and running, navigate to the directory where you cloned this project and run <code>bundle install</code> <br />
Once this process has finished you should be able to host a Rails server with <code>rails s</code> which will automatically locally host a server on port 3000. You can now connect this with the front end React portion of the project
